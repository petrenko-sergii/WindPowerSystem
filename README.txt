Web App "WindPowerSystem" helps to manage by data for electric wind turbines and wind farms.
Also it calculates incomes for turbineâ€™s shareholders according to how much a turbine produces electricity.

Currently Single Page Application (SPA) "WindPowerSystem" is in development phase and is developed by using:
-- C#/ ASP.NET Core 2.0 (backend layer based on RESTful APIs);
-- SQL: MSSQL- Entity Framework (at this moment) / Oracle-NHibernate (in future);
-- Typescript: Angular 5; 
-- HTML, CSS/ LESS, Bootstrap;
-- WebPack, Node.js;
-- Authentication (used token-based approach using JSON Web Tokens (JWT))
-- Mapster;

The app manages by data from the database: 
-- 22 related tables;
-- 1004 turbines and 31 types;
-- 11 wind farms;
-- 1062 shareholders (privacy and legal types);
-- shares for turbines / wind farms;
